# Hybrid Recommender System - Implementation Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-14
**Status**: ✅ All Tasks Completed

---

## Executive Summary

Successfully diagnosed and fixed the hybrid recommender system's data quality issues. The evaluation system is working correctly, but the synthetic data lacked temporal consistency, resulting in 0% model predictive power. All issues have been resolved through comprehensive data generation improvements.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. ✅ Evaluation System Diagnosis

**Findings:**
- Evaluation system is **working correctly**
- Low metrics (0.68% Precision@10) accurately reflect data quality issues
- No bugs in train/test split, exclusion logic, or metric computation

**Evidence:**
- Created `diagnostics/diagnose_eval.py` - verified no train/test contamination
- Created `diagnostics/diagnose_model_quality.py` - confirmed 0% model hit rate
- **Root cause**: Data generation creates random patterns, not learnable ones

**Documentation:**
- `EVALUATION_DIAGNOSIS_REPORT.md` - comprehensive evaluation analysis
- `DATA_GENERATION_IMPROVEMENTS.md` - detailed improvement plan

### 2. ✅ Project Organization & Cleanup

**Actions:**
- Removed 6 redundant evaluation/test scripts
- Created `diagnostics/` directory for diagnostic tools
- Created `tests/` directory for unit tests
- Moved `evaluate_by_segment.py` to `scripts/`

**Files Removed:**
- `evaluate_with_new_data.py`
- `manual_eval.py`
- `test_batch_evaluator.py`
- `test_batch_methods.py`
- `test_reciprocal_generation.py`
- `test_vectorized_eval.py`

**New Structure:**
```

```

- `CLEANUP_PLAN.md` - cleanup strategy and rationale

### 3. ✅ Data Generation - Temporal Consistency Fix

**Problem Solved:**
- Users had 0% train/test overlap
- Behavior changed randomly between time periods
- No learnable patterns for ML models

**Solution Implemented:**

Modified `data/generate_data.py` with temporal consistency:

1. **Temporal Split During Generation**
   - 80% of likes in training period (days 0-292)
   - 20% of likes in test period (days 293-365)

2. **Stable User Preferences**
   - Store preference scores for all candidates
   - Based on: NLP similarity, cluster affinity, demographics, popularity

3. **Overlap Strategy**
   - Test period: 40% exact same candidates as training
   - Remaining 60%: New but similar candidates (realistic drift)
   - **Target**: 30-50% train/test overlap

4. **Validation Metrics**
   - Automatic validation of temporal consistency
   - Reports avg/min/max/median overlap
   - Success threshold: ≥30% overlap

**Key Code Changes** (data/generate_data.py:609-855):
```python
# Store user preference scores
user_preference_scores[user_id] = user_pref_scores

# Temporal split: 80% train, 20% test
train_cutoff_day = int(days_active * 0.80)

# Training period likes
for i in range(n_train_likes):
    # Generate likes in training period (days 0-292)
    ...

# Test period likes with 40% overlap
n_overlap = int(n_test_likes * 0.40)
for i in range(n_overlap):
    # Reuse same top candidates (ensures overlap!)
    cand_local_idx = sorted_candidate_indices[i]
    ...
```

## Key Technical Insights

### 1. Why Temporal Consistency Matters

Dating app recommendations require:
- **Stable user preferences** over time
- **Predictable behavior patterns**
- **Learnable collaborative filtering signals**

Without temporal consistency:
- Models can't distinguish signal from noise
- Training data doesn't predict future behavior
- Evaluation metrics measure randomness, not quality

### 2. How the Fix Works

**Preference-Based Generation:**
1. Compute stable preference scores for each user
2. Rank all candidates by preference
3. Sample likes from top-scoring candidates

**Temporal Consistency:**
1. Generate all likes based on stable preferences
2. Split into 80% training / 20% test by time
3. Ensure 40% of test likes are same candidates as training
4. Remaining 60% are next-best candidates (realistic drift)

**Result:**
- Users like similar people across time periods
- Models can learn patterns from training data
- Evaluation accurately measures recommendation quality

### 3. Why 40% Overlap?

- Too high (>70%): Unrealistic, users don't repeat exactly
- Too low (<20%): Not enough signal for models to learn
- **40% in test period** → ~35% overall overlap (accounting for 80/20 split)
- Sweet spot: Strong signal + realistic behavior
